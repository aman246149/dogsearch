# Implementation 

So what I did ,I made an Api call in the starting of an app and store that list in the local state </br>
After that I did all the search functionality according to the requirement </br>

<hr>
So i choose above approach because there is various things going on in dog api,like sometimes i am getting empty data for some breeds and there is a limiter also </br>
to call an Api. </br>

also there are fixed no of dog breeds availabe in Dog Api around 172 ,so We can optimise our app and store the api call in our local database also, but for now our state is handling the data part.

<hr>
I used Mvc pattern in this project .
<br>
I also used lottie animation in the android part ,I didnt implement lottie animation in web part as it causes some rendering issues .
